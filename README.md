# PISM
PISM contains the code for the project we had to make for our course Prototyping Interactive System. 
We made an interactive book selection platform for book lovers. 

# How does it operate
There are 8 blocks, each of which has been assigned a particular genre. When the user picks up the blocks of the genre he/she wants to read, the books of the corresponding genre(s) is displayed on the hologram. The user can then navigate through the options of books displayed on the hologram, with the help of a wand, which has a flex sensor attached to it.
