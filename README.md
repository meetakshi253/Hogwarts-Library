This repository consists of two codes:
1. PISM.pde: this file contains the code for the graphics part of our project done in Processing 3.0, i.e., the content to be displayed on the hologram.
2. PISmajArduino.ino: this file contains the code for the hardware part done in Arduino IDE, i.e., the blocks (to choose genres) and the wand (to navigate through the book recoommendations).
